###What is the Hack Upstate Fellowship?
The Hack Upstate Fellowship program aims to pair quantitative and computational students with Upstate technology companies that demonstrate strong mentorship environments.

In doing so, the overarching intent is to connect, unify and empower the next generation of hackers in Upstate New York’s innovation community.

Standing up a summer Fellowship program will help expose the Upstate hacker community to favorable employment opportunities in Upstate’s growing technology sector, and increase the likelihood they will stay in Upstate New York.
